# [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/)

　　Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
- PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

　　Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
